/**
 * Operator-pinned 32-byte SHA-256 fingerprint of the AMD ARK (Root
 * Key) certificate.
 *
 * This is the trust anchor for browser-side AMD VCEK chain validation
 * (Slice D). When the adapter calls `verifyVcekChain`, it computes
 * SHA-256(ARK_DER) and compares to this constant; mismatch = the
 * server's bundled cert chain doesn't actually root at AMD's ARK.
 *
 * Pinned 2026-05-03 by the operator from the Turin family ARK at
 * https://kdsintf.amd.com/vcek/v1/Turin/cert_chain (second PEM block).
 *
 * To rotate (very rare — AMD ARKs have ~25-year validity):
 *   1. Re-fetch cert_chain.pem from AMD KDS.
 *   2. Run on the operator's laptop:
 *        # Split, then SHA-256 the ARK DER:
 *        csplit -z -f cert_ -b "%d.pem" cert_chain.pem '/-----BEGIN CERT/' '{*}'
 *        openssl x509 -in cert_1.pem -outform DER | sha256sum
 *   3. Replace the hex below + rebuild + redeploy the web bundle.
 *
 * Same fingerprint applies to all Turin-family chips. (Genoa, Milan,
 * etc. would have different ARKs and need their own pins; we only
 * deploy on Turin so far.)
